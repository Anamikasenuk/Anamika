          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Anamika Sengupta, a web developer with a background in
            textile and fashion technology. After spending more than two decades
            immersed in the world of textiles, design, fashion and technology, I
            decided to pursue my passion for coding and web development. Today,
            I blend creativity with technical expertise to create intuitive,
            user-centered websites and applications.
          </p>

          <h4>
            My Journey: From Textile/Fashion Technology to Web Development:
          </h4>
          <p>
            I am a Gold Medalist in B. Tech in textile and fashion technology
            from the University of Calcutta and a certified Sustainable Fashion
            professional from London College of Fashion. I worked on the cutting
            edge of design, production, and technology. Whether it was
            developing new fabrics, improving production processes, or creating
            innovative solutions for the fashion industry, I was constantly
            solving problems and thinking creatively. This experience laid a
            strong foundation for my transition into web development, where my
            technical knowledge and eye for design have become key assets.
          </p>

          <p>
            As I delved into the world of coding, I realized that many of the
            skills I had developed—attention to detail, problem-solving, and a
            deep understanding of how technology can shape user experiences—were
            directly transferable to web development. I quickly picked up HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, and I now focus
            on creating websites that are as functional as they are visually
            appealing.
          </p>
          <h4>What I Bring to the Table</h4>

          <p>
            Coming from the intersection of fashion and technology, I offer a
            unique perspective as a web developer. My background equips me with:
            • Design and User Experience: In fashion technology, understanding
            aesthetics and user preferences is key. I bring that same
            understanding to web design, ensuring that websites not only look
            great but also provide a seamless user experience. • Technical
            Precision: Working in fashion technology required precision in every
            aspect, from material specifications to production efficiency. I
            apply the same meticulous approach to writing clean, efficient code.
            • Creative Problem-Solving: Whether it was innovating with new
            materials or designing efficient workflows, creativity was a core
            part of my work. I bring that creativity to web development, finding
            innovative solutions for complex challenges. • Industry
            Adaptability: My experience in an ever-evolving industry has taught
            me to adapt quickly to new trends and technologies, making me a fast
            learner in the dynamic world of web development.
          </p>

          <h4>My Skills</h4>

          <h5>I specialize in:</h5>

          <p>
            • Front-End Development: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build
            responsive, visually appealing websites. • Back-End Development:
            Creating robust server-side applications with Node.js and Express,
            along with database management (MongoDB, MySQL). • UX/UI Design:
            Drawing on my fashion background to craft user-friendly interfaces
            that balance form and function. • Creative Solutions: Applying
            out-of-the-box thinking to design and code, ensuring that every
            project is both practical and unique.
          </p>

            allows me to bring a fresh, creative approach to building websites.
            I understand the importance of both aesthetics and functionality,
            and I have a proven track record of working in fast-paced, dynamic
            industries. Whether you’re looking for a sleek, modern website or a
